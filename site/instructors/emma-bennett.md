bio: Hi! I’m Emma (she/her) and I’m a rising junior at National Cathedral School
  in DC and will serve as the captain of NCS debate next year. I’ve done PF
  since middle school and started debating on the national circuit as a
  freshman, recently semi-finaling at Princeton and reaching outrounds at
  several tournaments like Blake, Jack Howe, and Nova Titan. With my experience
  as both a first and second speaker, I’d be happy to talk about collapse
  strategies, analytics, researching/casing, etc. Outside of debate, you can
  find me baking, running outside, occasionally binging Netflix, or vibing to
  music. So excited to work with y’all at NOVA!
