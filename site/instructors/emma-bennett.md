bio: Hi! I'm Emma (she/her) and a rising senior and debate captain at National
  Cathedral School (NCS) in DC. While debating on the national circuit for the
  last few years, notably I've reached semifinals at Princeton, quarterfinals at
  the Strake Round Robin, and also received TOC bids at tournaments such as
  Harvard and Cypress Bay. From volunteering at my local urban debate league to
  teaching here at NOVA last year, I love coaching and especially talking about
  fun rebuttal strategies/responses. Outside of debate you can find me on
  Spotify listening to Lana Del Rey or Mitski or going on long runs outside.
  Really excited to join NOVA this summer!
