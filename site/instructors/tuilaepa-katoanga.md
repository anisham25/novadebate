bio: Hello! My name is Tuilaepa Katoanga (he/him) and I am a rising senior at
  Regis High School. I've done debate since middle school, competing in PF on
  the local New York circuit as well as the national circuit. During the past
  three years, I've made it to semis at Columbia, quarters at Tim Averill, and,
  in my sophomore year, I was the top speaker at Columbia and NYSFL states. I
  specialize in traditional debate, focusing on how to create a compelling
  narrative by condensing the round, but I also have experience with technical
  debate as well. When I'm not debating, I love listening to Taylor Swift,
  watching TV, and writing. As a NOVA alum, I'm super excited to return as an
  instructor this year!
