bio: Hi! I'm Odin and I debate for American Heritage High School in Florida as a
  rising senior. Throughout my last two years of debate, I’ve made a bunch of
  great friends and qualified to TOC and to NSDA Nationals. I enjoy practicing
  with novices from my school and sharing my excitement in debate with others.
  Outside of PF, I love playing and watching basketball, competing in math
  competitions, and listening to music. Can’t wait to help out :)
