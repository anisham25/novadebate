bio: Hi, My name is Katherine (she/hers). I’m a rising junior at
  Acton-Boxborough where I have competed in Public Forum on both the national
  and local circuit. Over the past two years, I quarterfinaled and top-spoke the
  MSDL state tournament and broke at several national tournaments, qualifying to
  the STOC my sophomore year. This upcoming seasonI will be serving as captain
  at my school’s Public Forum team. Outside of debate, I enjoy spending time
  outdoors, painting, and hanging out with my dog. I’m super excited to work
  with you all!
