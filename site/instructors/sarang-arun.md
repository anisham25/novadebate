bio: Hey! I'm Sarang (he/him) and a rising freshman in college (Emory!). I've
  competed for and served as the team captain of the National Cathedral School
  (St. Albans) and Potomac Debate Academy. While debating on the national
  circuit, I've reached semifinals at Princeton, quarterfinals at the Strake
  Round Robin, championed the UK Season Opener, and received TOC bids at
  tournaments such as Harvard and Cypress Bay. After working at NOVA last year,
  I'm incredibly grateful to be teaching alongside talented staff and
  instructing passionate students again this year! I have experience as both a
  first and second speaker and would love to discuss back-half strategies and
  how to perfect a summary speech. Outside of debate, you can find me listening
  to Kanye, LDR, and Kendrick on Spotify or sending Emma my math homework to
  check if it's accurate. Super excited to join NOVA again this summer.
