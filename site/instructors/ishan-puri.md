bio: "Hi! I'm Ishan, and I'm a rising Junior at Thomas S. Wootton High School
  where I serve as the Captain of our Debate Program. I've been debating
  competitively on the National Circuit since Freshman year, and over this time
  I have qualified to TOC as well as reached late out rounds at tournaments such
  as Georgetown and GMU. This year, I broke to quarterfinals at Silver TOC and
  also received the tenth speaker award. Outside of Debate, I play tennis and
  enjoy video games. I look forward to working with y'all this summer!  "
