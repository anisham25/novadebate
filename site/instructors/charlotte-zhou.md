bio: Hi! I'm Charlotte and a rising senior at Bronx Science. I've done PF for
  the past three years on the both the national and local circuits. Notably,
  I've reached quarterfinals at Princeton, octofinals at Durham, and octofinals
  at the 2022 Silver TOC. I'm a first speaker, so I'd be able to help in depth
  with summary, such as effective time management, collapsing, frontlining, and
  weighing. I have experience in both progressive and lay debate, so I'd love to
  go over different in-round strategies and methods of argumentation as well. In
  my free time, I like to read and watch soccer. I taught a lab at NOVA last
  year, and I look forward to returning!
