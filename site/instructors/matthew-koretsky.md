bio: Hi! I'm Matthew (he/him) and I'm a rising senior at Fort Lee High School.
  I've been involved with Public Forum for about 4 years. As a competitor, I've
  received a total of 7 gold bids to the Tournament of Champions, and have
  reached late elimination rounds at the Villiger, Pennsbury, UPenn, and Milo
  Cup tournaments. I've also coached several teams as a volunteer, ranging from
  experienced debaters to completely new ones. Outside of debate, I like music,
  sports, video games, and a lot of other stuff. Can't wait to teach at Nova
  this summer!
