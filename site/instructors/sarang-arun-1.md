bio: "\" Hi! I'm Sarang, and I'm a junior debating for National Cathedral. I've
  reached out-rounds at numerous tournaments, including Georgetown, Blake, Jack
  Howe, and Durham. Additionally, I earned top speaker and semi-finaled the
  Princeton Classic on top of championing The UK Season Opener this season,
  acquiring two gold bids to the Tournament of Champions! I'm most comfortable
  helping with casing, analytics, weighing, and overall back half strategies. I
  have experience speaking both first and second, so I'd love to discuss
  rebuttal strats as well as summary. Outside of debate, I love to hang with
  friends & listen to cool music. I can't wait to work with y'all this summer at
  Nova!\""
