bio: Hi! I’m Sivapriya (she/her), a rising junior at Acton-Boxborough Regional
  High School. I’ve competed in Public Forum for 2 years on both the national
  and local circuit. In my sophomore year, I’ve amassed several speaker awards
  and reached late out-rounds at numerous tournaments. Notably, I’ve bidded at
  UPenn and Glenbrooks and competed at the Silver TOC, this year. I’ve
  octofinaled UPenn and placed at Manch, UK, Yale, and Glenbrooks. I’m always
  looking for ways to make debate more inclusive! I’ve mentored countless
  novices. Outside of PF, I love reading, baking, and watching Grey’s Anatomy!
  I’m psyched for NOVA and excited to meet y’all! :))
