bio: Hi! I’m Claire (she/her) and I’m a rising senior at College Prep in
  Oakland, CA. I’ve done PF for the past three years, and I partner with my twin
  brother, which is pretty fun (most of the time). This season, I got 3 gold
  bids and 2 silver bids and broke at nearly every tournament I went to,
  including Gold TOC! Outside of debate, I like baking, math, and playing tennis
  and hanging out with my friends. I love helping coach the novices on my team
  and can’t wait to work at NOVA this summer!
