bio: Hi! My name is Reva Sharma and I'm a rising senior at Mira Loma High
  School. I'm the President of my school's speech and debate club, and I've been
  doing public forum for around 3 years. This year I qualified to NCFL
  nationals, NSDA, TOC, and California States. I'm pretty experienced with lay,
  flay, and trad flow debate. This is my second year teaching at NOVA, I've
  taught at my own local camp for 2 years, and give private coaching to a decent
  amount of students. I absolutely love debate and love most debaters which is
  why I'm super excited to teach y'all this summer!
