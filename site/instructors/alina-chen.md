bio: Hi! My name is Alina Chen (she/her) and I'm a rising junior at Thomas
  Jefferson High School for Science Technology. I've competed in both the
  national and local circuit in Public Forum, and have placed first at States,
  qualified for NSDA Nationals, and reached out-rounds at Durham. I also coach
  my high school's novices, and help out with the team. Outside of debate, I
  enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and hanging out with my
  friends. I'm excited to meet everybody this summer!
