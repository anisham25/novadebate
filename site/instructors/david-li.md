bio: David is a rising senior at Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria,
  Virginia, and he has debated for the past 3 years. This year, he accrued 5
  bids, ranked as high as 7th in the nation, and reached outrounds at Bronx, UK
  Season Opener, Yale, UPenn, and Princeton. David and his partner also
  previously qualified to TOC and NCFL, and placed top 30 at NSDA Nationals. As
  the teaching coordinator for TJ Public forum and a returning NOVA instructor,
  he has had a blast mentoring debaters of all divisions, whether it is helping
  write cases or doing drills. In his free time, David enjoys going on walks
  with his Shih-Tzu Cow, listening to music, and playing chess. He is excited to
  direct at NOVA Debate this year!
