bio: Hi! I'm David (he/him) and I am a rising junior at TJHSST. This is my 3rd
  year on the local and national circuit, and have amassed 3 bids at Princeton,
  Sunvite, and UNLV this year. I enjoy mentoring and working with other debaters
  at my school, especially when it comes to case writing and other fun strategic
  drills. When it comes to debate styles and preference, I enjoy flow and lay
  debating along with progressive  argumentation. In my free time, I enjoy
  playing chess, listening to music, and petting my dog. I learned a lot
  attending NOVA last year and can't wait to being teaching this summer!
