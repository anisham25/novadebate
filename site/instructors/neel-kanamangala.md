bio: Hey! I’m Neel (any pronouns) and I’m a rising senior at Plano East Senior
  High. I’ve been consistently ranked within the top 20 PF teams in Texas,
  notably being the top speaker at Plano West and going undefeated in prelims at
  TFA State as a sophomore. As a junior, I broke at next to every tournament I
  attended. I also have a bit of experience with LD and World Schools. I’m one
  of the directors at The Debate Group, a student-run mentorship organization,
  and am working on PF Forward, an initiative to make progressive arguments in
  PF more accessible. Outside of debate, I like to listen to music, bike around,
  and swim!
