bio: Hello! I'm Ellen (she/her), a rising junior at Poolesville Highschool. Over
  the past three years on the national circuit, Iâ€™ve been ranked as high as the
  20th best PF team in the Nation, championed NYU, semied Mid-America Cup, and
  quartered Harvard. Additionally, I qualified to the TOC every single year of
  my debate career and reached octos at Upenn, UK, and Stanford. Outside of
  debate, I enjoy listening to music and playing lacrosse :) I can't wait to
  work with everyone this summer!!
