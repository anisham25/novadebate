bio: Hi! I’m Sana (she/her), a rising sophomore at Riverdale Country School in
  Bronx, NY. I’ve been debating since sixth grade, and this year I semifinaled
  Silver TOC, reached octas at NCDA, and got a speaker award at Stanford. I also
  placed second at the Lakeland Round Robin. I’m the youngest member of my team
  to ever qualify for TOC and break at numerous varsity tournaments. I also have
  some experience with Worlds schools, and I’ve helped organize tournaments for
  Worlds that make the activity more accessible. I’m an assistant debate coach
  at a middle school, and I have a lot of experience working with the novices at
  my school! Outside of debate, I love to run, bake, drink coffee and hang out
  with my friends. I’m so excited to meet everyone at NOVA this summer!
