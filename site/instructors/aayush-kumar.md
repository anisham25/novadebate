bio: Hey, I’m Aayush! I’ve been PF debating since around 7th grade and got a few
  bids and stuff. My partner and I were ranked top 15, went to Gold TOC, and
  qualified for nationals this past season. As a rising senior at Ravenwood High
  School and the debate team’s head captain, I have gotten pretty good at
  helping new debaters understand the competitive debate space. I’ve worked with
  aspiring public speakers of all ages and can’t wait to share my knowledge with
  everyone at NOVA! Outside debate, I love to hike, follow Formula 1, play
  classical sax, and recreationally SCUBA dive. Oh, I also listen to music of
  all kinds, so send your favorites! A presto-
