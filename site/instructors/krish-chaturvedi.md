bio: Hi! My name is Krish (he/him) and I am a rising senior at St. Thomas
  Aquinas High School.  I am the debate captain for my schoolâ€™s forensic team.
  I've been competing in PF on the local and national circuit for 3 years now
  and have amassed 6 TOC bids.  Most recently, I reached the quarterfinals at
  FFL Varsity States and competed at TOC Gold.  I have experience with all forms
  of debating ranging from lay debate to writing and running Ks and theory. In
  my free time I love to play piano and listen to music.
