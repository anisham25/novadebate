bio: Hey! I'm Varnica, and I've debated in PF for 3 years at Lambert High School
  in Georgia. I've qualified to the TOC 2x, and accumulated 3 gold bids and 1
  silver bid this season as a sophomore. I've had many deep elim runs at
  tournaments like Columbia, UPenn, Stanford, and Jack Howe. I like listening to
  Bazzi and Blackbear in my free time, and can't wait to work with everyone this
  summer!
