bio: Hi! I'm Karin (she/her) and I've debated for Oakton for three years.
  Nationally, I've qualified to the TOC, bidding at ASU, Blue Key, Stanford, and
  UK, while locally I've qualified to Varsity Metrofinals twice and won VHSL
  regionals twice. I'm the captain of Oakton's PF team where I handle meetings
  and tournaments while coaching novices and varsity alike, and I'm an
  instructor at BTL, a debate education nonprofit. I love baking, watching crime
  TV shows, and listening to crime podcasts. Can't wait to return to NOVA this
  summer!
