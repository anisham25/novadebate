bio: Hi! I'm Sonal (she/her) and I'm currently a rising senior at Northview High
  School in Atlanta, Georgia where I've done public forum debate for 2 years.
  Over the years, I have co-championed our districts tournament and been a
  finalist at our state tournament. Nationally, I have reached semifinals at the
  Grapevine invitational, quarterfinals at the Apple Valley invitational, and
  elims at several other tournaments including Yale, Glenbrooks, and Blue Key. I
  qualified to TOC and NSDA Nationals, where I reached deep elim rounds. Outside
  of debate, I enjoy baking and binge watching Greys Anatomy and Criminal Minds.
  Excited to work with you this summer!!(edited)
