bio: Hi! I'm Sonal (she/her) and I'm currently a rising senior at Northview High
  School in Atlanta, Georgia where I've done public forum debate for 2
  years.  Over the years, I have co-championed our districts tournament and been
  a finalist at our state tournament. Nationally, I have reached semifinals at
  the Grapevine invitational, quarterfinals at the Apple Valley invitational,
  andbelims at several other tournaments including Yale, Glenbrooks, and Blue
  Key. I qualified to TOC and NSDA Nationals, where I reached deep elim rounds.
  Outside of debate, I enjoy baking and binge watching Greys Anatomy and
  Criminal Minds. Excited to work with you this summer!!
