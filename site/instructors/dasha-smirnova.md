bio: Hi y'all! My name is Dasha and I'm a rising senior at Bronx Science in New
  York City. I've been debating for five years and I'm currently the novice
  director of PF at Bronx Science. I've reached outrounds at Yale, UK Season
  Opener, Blake, Lakeland, and Scarsdale. Notably, I've championed Durham and
  NYSFL States and qualified to Silver TOC. I taught at Nova last year and I'm
  excited to be back!
