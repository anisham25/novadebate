bio: Hi! I'm Dasha (she/her). I'm a rising junior at Bronx Science in NYC and
  serve as one of my team's Novice Directors. I like all types of debate, from
  traditional debate to framing and Ks. I've competed in both the national and
  local circuit in Public Forum, championed States, and reached out-rounds at
  Durham and Lakeland. In my free time, I like reading poetry, playing Stardew
  Valley, and scavenging Depop. I'm excited to meet everybody this summer!
