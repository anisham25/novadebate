bio: "Hey! I'm Ani (he/him) and I'm a rising senior at Durham Academy. I've been
  competing on the national and local PF circuit for the past three years, and
  during that time I've been ranked as high as the best PF team in the nation.
  Over the past two years, I've been ranked as the top PF team in North
  Carolina, qualifying to the gold TOC both years and earning 13 bids: seven
  gold and six silver. Notably, I've championed Isidore Newman, Duke, and the
  Strake Round Robin, while co-championing Sunvite and UK. I also finaled the
  NDCA championship, semied Emory, and quartered Harvard, while earning several
  speaker awards and co-championing my state tournament. Currently, I am the
  JV-Trainer for Durham Academy's Public Forum Team, working with our novices
  and JVers for the past two years. When I'm not debating, I like to play
  volleyball, listen to music, pet dogs, and hang with friends. I'm super
  excited to work with y'all this summer!"
