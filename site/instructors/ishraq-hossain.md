bio: Hello! My name is Ishraq and I’m a rising senior at Del Norte High School
  in San Diego, California. Throughout my three years competing on the national
  circuit, I’ve amassed 15 bids to the Tournament of Champions and received
  first-speaker awards at the California Invitational, Peach State, and
  Presentation. I’ve broken at the TOC and placed 17th at the NSDA Nationals.
  I’ve also coached teams that have qualified for the TOC and California State
  Tournament. Outside of debate, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and
  reading. I’m excited to work with all of you this summer!
