bio: "I'm Usho! I've been debating at Taipei American for 3 years, with
  experience in PF and WSDC. As a rising junior, I've qualified to TOC and
  Nationals both years, with 5 bids and consistent breaks across the board,
  being ranked the current #2 international team. I'm a first speaker, meaning
  that I can help with anything ranging from collapse strategies, meta weighing
  to lay persuasive frontlines and rhetoric. When I'm not debating or teaching
  our Middle School Program, you can find me watching True Crime shows. "
