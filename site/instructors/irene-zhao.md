bio: Hi! Iâ€™m Irene (she/her), a rising senior at Sidwell in DC. Over the past
  two years, I qualified twice to the Tournament of Champions, octofinaling
  Harvard and semifinaling Alta this season. I also compete on my local circuit,
  where I qualified to Metrofinals. Outside of competing, I work on Beyond
  Resolved's monthly Argument Breakdowns, and coached at Nova last summer. In my
  spare time, I enjoy frolicking about with my dog Coco and listening to
  mediocre indie rock bands. Nova is genuinely a blast, and I'm excited to
  return!
