bio: Hi!! I’m Irene (she/her) and I currently debate PF for Sidwell in
  Washington, DC. This season, I reached elimination rounds at several national
  circuit tournaments, semifinaling at Georgetown, quartering Pennsbury, and
  octofinaling SCU and Jack Howe. Other than competing, I’ve worked with
  debaters on my local circuit during the summer, and judged tournaments
  throughout the year. Outside of debate, I love baking bread and listening to
  Giveon. Looking forward to Nova!
