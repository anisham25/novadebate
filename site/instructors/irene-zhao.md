bio: Irene Zhao debated for four years at Sidwell Friends School in Washington
  D.C. Across her career, she amassed 7 career bids and cleared at both the TOC
  and NCFLs, most notably championing Georgetown her senior year. Aside from
  competing, she has worked closely with novices at her school as a captain and
  written monthly argument breakdowns through Beyond Resolved. Aside from
  debate, Irene enjoys sampling different flavors of Goldfish (pumpkin spice
  Goldfish!) and listening to Maggie Rogers. Irene has taught at NOVA for the
  past two years, and is excited to return!
