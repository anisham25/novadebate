bio: Hey! I'm Marina (she/her). I'm a rising senior & I've debated for three
  years at Bronx Science. I've earned two bids and championed Durham this year,
  and states my freshman year. I find all types of debate interesting, but I
  especially enjoy reading progressive argumentation -- This year I read a
  Killjoy K and my sophomore year I read a lot of fem framing and the occasional
  theory shell. In my free time, I play volleyball and rock climb. Excited to
  work with y'all!
