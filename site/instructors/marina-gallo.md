bio: Hi! I’m Marina (she/her) and I’m a rising junior at Bronx Science. Over the
  past two years, I’ve competed in PF on both the national and local circuit,
  breaking at both Durham and Lakeland. Last year on the local circuit, my
  partner and I championed states. I’ll be a novice director for my team this
  upcoming year. I have experience with both running and responding to a variety
  of arguments, whether they be purely substance or progressive. I strongly
  believe in first speaker supremacy. Outside of debate, I play volleyball,
  listen to Mac Miller, and look at photos of capybaras. I’m excited to work
  with y’all!
