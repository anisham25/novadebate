bio: Hello! I am Andrew Jones, a graduating senior at Oakton High School who has
  competed in public forum for five years. Notably, I've reached semi-finals at
  the University of Pennsylvania, served as president of the Oakton Debate Team,
  and served as director of NOVA Debate last summer. In my free time I coach
  debate, read, and play video games. I'm looking forward to a great time at
  camp this year!
