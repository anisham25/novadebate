bio: "Hi! I'm Benjamin, and I did one year of MSPDP before starting public forum
  debate in freshman year. This is my first year as a counselor, although I've
  helped many novice debaters with prep and scrimmage rounds before. Some fun
  facts about me are: I have two dogs, I do cross country and theatre, and my
  favorite book is the Da Vinci Code. I cannot wait to instruct at NOVA this
  year."
