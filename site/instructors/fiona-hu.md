bio: "Hi! My name is Fiona Hu (she/they) and I have been debating for 3 years
  now. This year, I qualled to gold TOC and accumulated 2 gold and 3 silver
  bids. I semi-finaled Yale, Laird Lewis and the Harvard Round Robin, and
  finaled Duke. I broke to octos at Durham and GMU, and reached outrounds at
  Glenbrooks, and Harvard. In addition to qualifying to TOC, I also qualified
  twice in row to NCFLs. In terms of experience, I have debated everything from
  lay debate to progressive K rounds. I have also taught novices starting from
  sophomore year. My favorite music artist is Lana Del Rey. I cannot wait to
  teach this summer! "
