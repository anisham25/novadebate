bio: Hello! My name is Asmi (she/her), and I am a junior. I have debated for 4
  years at Sidwell Friends in DC. I have competed in PF for two years, and over
  the course of this past year I earned 6 bids; 4 gold and 2 silver. I have
  broken at every tournament this year, reached semis at Jack Howe and
  Pennsbury, and championed SCU. Outside of PF, I am part of the Beyond Resolved
  staff as the Northeastern Merch Coordinator. I am excited to work at NOVA this
  summer :))))
