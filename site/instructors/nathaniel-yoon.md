bio: Hello! I'm Nathaniel (he/him), I debated for Oakton and now for Johns
  Hopkins. In high school I mostly competed in PF, receiving seven bids and
  ranking high as first nationally while competing locally in all formats, and
  in college I've broken at the North American Debating Championship and APDA
  Nationals. I also coached the Oakton team for three years, and after
  graduating coach many teams who are doing great! I've worked on NOVA for the
  past two summers, as well as many other camps, and I'm real pumped to instruct
  this summer!
