bio: Hello, I'm Nathaniel (he/him) and I'll be the adult supervisor for NOVA
  this year! I attend Johns Hopkins University where I'm the president of the
  debate team, and attended Oakton High School where I debated and served as the
  team's coach for three years. In college, I broke at Nationals, NAUDC, and
  Northams, and in high school, I competed nationally and locally and qualified
  to the TOC. I've also coached privately, taught at summer camps since 2018,
  and organized NOVA for the past three years. See you this summer!
