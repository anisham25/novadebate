bio: Hi! I’m Alex Huang (they/he), a rising senior at Durham Academy in North
  Carolina where I’ve debated for three years. In my two years on the national
  circuit, I’ve won the TOC, Yale, NCFLs, the King Round Robin, and the NC State
  Championship, accumulating 10 bids along the way, and making deep outrounds at
  UK and Sunvite. Being the novice trainer at Durham, and working with my many
  teammates, I have a great deal of experiencing teaching debate ranging from
  the basics to the cutting edge, and I am excited to share all of that with
  y’all! Away from debate, I love soccer, photography, and listening to Mac
  Miller. I will maybe beat a quarter of you at chess, and all of you at Tetris.
  I hope to see you at camp!
