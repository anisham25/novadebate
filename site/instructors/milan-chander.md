bio: "Hi! I’m Milan (he/him) and I’m a rising junior at Sidwell Friends. I’ve
  debated PF for a couple years, mostly as a sophomore on the national circuit.
  During the season, I debated in late outrounds across multiple tournaments and
  earned three silver bids as well as several speaker awards. Most recently, at
  silver TOC, I got 5th seed and 3rd speaker. Outside of debate, I like to drum,
  play games, and watch youtube. I’m excited to see you all at NOVA! "
