bio: Hi! I’m Milan (he/him), a rising senior at Sidwell Friends in DC. In the
  last two years I qualified two times to TOC. This season, I octofinaled
  Harvard and semifinaled Alta, qualified to NCFLs through my local circuit, and
  earned several speaker awards, including 2nd speaker at Seattle. In my free
  time, I can be found drumming, playing Minecraft, listening to the Beatles, or
  loafing about with my little dog Dobby. I had so much fun teaching at NOVA
  last summer and I can’t wait to come back!
