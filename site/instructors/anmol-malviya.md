bio: Hey! I'm Anmol (he/him) and I'm a rising senior at Oakton, where I've
  debated for two years. Nationally, I've qualified to the TOC, quarterfinalling
  ASU and Blue Key, and bidding at Stanford and UK, while receiving speaker
  awards at UPenn, Blue Key, UK, and the TOC. Locally, I've won VHSL Regionals
  and qualified to Varsity Metrofinals. I'm also the Vice President of Oakton's
  debate team, where I handle logistics and coach for our student-led program.
  Outside of debate, I love playing COD and Minecraft with my friends, and I
  love cooking too. I'm excited to return to NOVA this year!
