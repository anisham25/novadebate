bio: Hello! I'm Anmol (he/him), and I debate for Oakton High School as a rising
  senior. Aside from competitive success, I've been involved serving as the Vice
  President of the Oakton Debate Team. I help register for tournaments, handle
  logistics, and coach for our student run program. I was a counselor at NOVA
  last year, and I can't wait to instruct this year!
