bio: "Hey! I’m Carson (he/him) and I’m a rising senior at Bronx Science, where I
  serve as a Novice Director for the PF team. While competing I’ve amassed 5
  bids including at Harvard, Glenbrooks, and Durham. Last year I placed 10th at
  the NSDA tournament receiving an automatic qualification to the TOC. When I’m
  not debating I like to skate, play video games, and watch soccer. I had a
  blast last year being a member of a NOVA lab, and I’m excited to be able to
  lead one now! "
