bio: Hi! I’m Abhiram (he/him) and I’m a rising senior at Edgemont where I
  compete in Public Forum. I’ve earned 5 bids to the TOC, and my most notable
  achievements include finals at lex, semis at Blake, and late outrounds at
  Emory, Grapevine, and Nano Nagle. In addition, I’ve earned several speaker
  awards, most notably 5th speaker at Emory. Locally, I placed at first at my
  district qualifier and qualled to Nats. On my team, I’ve been captain of our
  parli program since its inception. Outside of debate, I love to bake, cook,
  and FaceTime my lovely partner Anisha. I'm super excited to meet and work with
  you all at NOVA this summer!
