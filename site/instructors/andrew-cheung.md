bio: "Hi I’m Andrew (he/him)! I’m a rising senior and I've debated at Summit for
  3 years. I qualified to gold TOC my sophomore and junior years with 5 career
  bids. I championed Ridge, semifinaled Villiger and Millard North, and reached
  outrounds at Yale, Bronx, Princeton, Harvard, and more. I’ve broken at every
  tournament my junior year and I’ve also received speaker awards at Bronx and
  Milo. I’m experienced in both technical theory debate and super lay debate,
  and I enjoy creative round vision and warrant comparison. Outside debate, I
  love playing ice hockey and listening to music. I’m super excited to meet
  everyone and teach at NOVA this summer! "
