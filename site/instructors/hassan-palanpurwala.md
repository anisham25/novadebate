bio: Hello, my name Is Hassan Palanpurwala and I attend West Broward High
  School. I started debate and PF in 7th grade and now serve as the Vice
  President of my debate team. During my debate career, I have made it to elims
  in PF at Sunvite, Emory, Holy Cross, dabbled in LD, and also qualified to the
  TOC in PF. I also qualified to the FFL state tournament in PF, but made
  semifinals in International Extemporaneous Speaking!?!? I love progressive
  debate and have read almost any argument you can think of (non-t affs, theory,
  k, etc.). However, I especially enjoy identity arguments and framing debates.
  In my free time I love to listen to music and I can also move my ears. My
  biggest accomplishment is being Ethan Roytmans debate partner in 8th grade,
  and I cannot wait to teach at Nova!
