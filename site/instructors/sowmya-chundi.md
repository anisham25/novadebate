bio: Hi! My name is Sowmya and I’m a rising senior at Carmel High School and
  captain of my school’s Public Forum debate team. I’ve only been on the circuit
  for one year, but I’ve had a few successes in reaching outrounds at the Mid
  America Cup, Florida Blue Key, and Cal State Tournament. As a junior, I
  reached octofinals at Silver TOC and won a speaker award. I’m really excited
  to work with students at Nova, and I have a lot of experience coming from a
  small school and growing our debate program. Outside of debate, I love
  photography and playing ultimate frisbee! I’m super excited to meet y’all this
  summer!
