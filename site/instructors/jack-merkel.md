bio: Hi! My name is Jack Merkel (he/him) and I competed in Public Forum Debate
  for 3 years at Cosby High School.  Cumulatively I have ammased two gold bids
  to the Tournament of Champions reaching quarterfinals at the GMU and Dowling

  Pennsylvania tournaments.  Coaching wise I have been the captain of the Public
  Forum and overall debate team for Cosby for 2 years, helping many teams find
  success at local tournaments and qualify for states.  I can't wait to instruct
  you all this summer!
