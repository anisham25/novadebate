bio: Hi! I'm Sarvesh and I'm a prospective freshman at Stanford this fall. I
  served as a captain on the duPont Manual debate team, and I've competed in LD,
  PF, and started the policy team at my high school. I've has had strong success
  on the national circuit in Public Forum, consistently reaching elimination
  rounds at numerous tournaments (Yale, Blue-key, UK, etc.) Notably, I reached
  the semifinals round at Harvard, qualified for Gold TOC, and was in the top 16
  in IPPF. I've coached several teams this summer who have gone on to reaching
  late out-rounds at national circuit tournaments. I can't wait to work with you
  at Nova!
