bio: Salutations, Iâ€™m Mason and a rising senior for American Heritage Broward. I
  am the C of American Heritage Broward RC. I predominantly do LD but
  temporarily switched over to PF my junior year. My debate interests include
  philosophy, theory, tricks, and impact turns. I have also recently picked up a
  passion for lay debate. I have qualled to the TOC in both LD and PF and have
  qualled to States and Nats in Policy. My favorite animals are bunnies and
  panda bears. I am filled with adrenaline and exhilarated to teach at Nova this
  year!
