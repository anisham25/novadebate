bio: Hi! I’m Katheryne. I’m a graduating senior from Whitman High School in
  Bethesda, MD. This will be my third year working at Nova, and I’m so excited
  to get to meet all of you! I competed in national circuit PF for 3 years,
  accumulating 13 career gold bids. Most notably, I twice won Valley Mid America
  cup, finaled the Harvard RR (2021), semifinaled Blake (2022), the Harvard RR
  (2022), and the Blake RR, quarterfinaled Harvard, Blake (2021), and Stanford.
  I’ve also gotten many top 5 speaker awards, including top speaking the Harvard
  RR, Lakeland, and Lexington, and getting other top 5 awards at Blake, the
  Blake RR, Ivy Street RR, Bronx, and more. I’m comfortable with lots of
  different types of arguments and am really looking forwards to work with all
  of you.
