bio: Hi!! I’m Katheryne and I debate for Walt Whitman in Bethesda, MD. I’m a
  junior and have debated for two years on the national circuit. In that time,
  I’ve earned 10 career bids including 8 gold bids and qualified to TOC twice.
  My junior year I won Valley, finaled the Harvard RR, and quartered Harvard,
  Stanford, and Blake. In terms of coaching, I worked at multiple camps last
  year (including Nova!), worked with a bunch of mentorship programs, and
  coached kids both inside and outside of the Whitman team. I love working with
  younger debaters and helping people find their stride in debate, super excited
  to help you do that this summer!
