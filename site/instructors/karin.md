bio: Hi! Iâ€™m Karin (she/her) and I've debated for Oakton for three years.
  Nationally, I've qualified to NCFLs and the TOC, bidding at ASU, Blue Key,
  Stanford, and UK, while locally I've qualified to Varsity Metrofinals, winning
  VHSL regionals/super regionals. I'm the captain of Oakton's PF team where I
  handle meetings and tournaments while coaching novices and varsity alike, and
  I'm also an instructor at BTL, a debate education nonprofit. I can't wait to
  return to NOVA this summer!
