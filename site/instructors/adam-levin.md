bio: Hi! I’m Adam (he/him) and I’m a rising senior at Cary Academy in North
  Carolina. I’ve debated in Public Forum for three years and in my two years on
  the national circuit I’ve accrued 5 bids, qualified to TOC, NCFLs, and NSDAs.
  I’ve Finaled Laird Lewis, Semifinaled Durham, and reached elimination rounds
  at Blue Key, Milo, Yale, GMU, Glenbrooks, and NCFLs, obtaining 5th speaker at
  Glenbrooks. I’ve attended Nova for 2 years and have coached many of the
  novices at Cary Academy. This summer, I’m especially excited to discuss
  narrative styles of debate and crossfire strategies. Outside of debate, I love
  swimming, cooking, and watching New Girl. I can’t wait to teach this summer!
