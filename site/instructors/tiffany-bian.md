bio: Hi, I'm Tiffany! I'm a rising senior at Dulles High School where I was the
  pf captain there my junior year, which has provided me plenty of experience
  mentoring both novice and varsity teams. Throughout my career, I've qualified
  to TOC Gold with five bids, qualified to NSDA nationals, and qualified for TFA
  State twice. I've reached elim rounds at almost every one of the 11 bid
  tournaments I attended this year, including Stanford, octos at Bellaire and
  Peach State, and quarters at U of H and the Milo Cup. I have lots of
  experience in fem framing and fem arguments, theory, as well as standard tech
  and lay debate. In my free time, I love playing tennis and video games. So
  excited to be working with y'all this summer!
