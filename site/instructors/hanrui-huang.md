bio: Hi! I'm Hanrui Huang, and attending Duke University as a Freshman in the
  Fall. I competed in Public Forum Debate for Westview High School for three
  years. I've coached for kids from middle school to high school for each of the
  last two years, all of whom have competed locally. Other than debate, I'm a
  huge basketball fan, and I'm super excited to work with all of you!
