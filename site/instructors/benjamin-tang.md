bio: Hey! My name is Benjamin Tang and I'm a rising senior at Winston Churchill
  Highschool. I have been competing since my freshman year and have earned four
  bids over the past two years, qualifying to the TOC both my sophomore and
  junior year. Notably, I have semifinaled Stanford and octofinaled at Durham,
  while also reaching outrounds at tournaments such as Columbia, Stanford,
  Harvard, and UPenn. As the captain of my schools debate team, I have plenty of
  experience coaching PF. I am comfortable with all styles of debate, having
  debated on the local circuit as well as having run progressive arguments.
  Looking forward to working with all of you this summer!
