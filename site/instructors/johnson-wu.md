bio: "Johnson Wu debated PF for Vancouver Debate Academy for the past 5 years,
  where he has qualified to the TOC in every single year of his debate career.
  Specifically, he has acquired 7 bids in his junior year alone, making him the
  first international team in the 20+ year history of Public Forum to amass such
  a quantity. During this time, he has co-championed SCU, Georgetown, Puget
  Sound, and has consistently broken into far outrounds at numerous other
  tournaments. Over the past year, Johnson has been coaching both privately and
  at Vancouver Debate Academy. During his free time, he enjoys playing classical
  music, taking his girlfriend out on dates, and laying on his sofa with his
  cats. Johnson is looking forward to working with everyone this summer! "
