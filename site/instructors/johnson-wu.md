bio: "Hello! I’m Johnson (he/him) and I’ve debated for VDA Vancouver for 4
  years. I mostly compete in Public Forum although I do enjoy impromptu debate
  formats such as Worlds, BP, and CNDF from time to time. I’ve acquired over
  half a dozen bids this season, co-champed SCU and Puget, and have qualified to
  the TOC every single year of my debate career. In my free time, I enjoy
  practicing piano, playing badminton, and laying on the sofa with my cats.  I’m
  looking forward to working with everyone at NOVA! "
