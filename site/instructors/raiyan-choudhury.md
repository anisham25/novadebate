bio: Hey y'all I'm Raiyan (he/him) and I'm a rising senior at BASIS Chandler
  High School from Chandler, Arizona. I started debate in 10th grade and have
  competed on the national circuit for 1 year. Over the course of my first year
  in varsity this season, I have accumulated 2 gold bids at ASU and Blake, 4
  silver bids, and championed the Arizona State District Tournament. I really
  like techy substance rounds, but I also have a ton of experience debating
  lay/flay. As a captain of my school's PF team and the first PF Team from my
  school in over 5 years, I know a lot about learning the fundamentals of debate
  in a quick timeframe as well as helping novices with argumentation and
  casewriting. Honestly I spend most of my time doing debate, but outside of it,
  I like listening to music, watching the Walking Dead, and eating pretzels from
  the mall. I can't wait to help out at NOVA this summer!
