bio: Hi, I’m Mitra! I’m a rising junior at Walt Whitman in Bethesda, MD and a
  captain of the PF team. I have been debating for the last two years on the
  national circuit and the local circuit. This past season, I have accumulated 4
  bids (2 gold + 2 silver) at Harvard, Mid America Cup, Princeton, and Apple
  Valley. I have also made it to elimination rounds at Columbia and Lexington,
  where I received a speaker award. On the local circuit my freshman year, I
  competed at many WACFLs and qualified to the Metrofinals. Outside of debate, I
  love going on walks, listening to music, hanging out with friends, shopping,
  and travelling! I attended NOVA last year and I’m so excited to work with you
  all this summer!!!
