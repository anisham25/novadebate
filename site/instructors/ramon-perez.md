bio: "Hey! My name is Ramon, I'm going to be a rising Junior at West Broward
  High School, where I am the Captain of Public Forum. Coming from a school with
  a smaller debate program I created publicforumnow.com to try and challenge the
  resource inequity in debate by creating free and accessible resources for
  everyone! I attended Nova Debate camp last year and it helped me improve a
  lot, since then I got to quarters and 11th spoke Sunvite, I got to quarters
  and 7th spoke Nova Titan, broke at Emory, as well as qualified to FFL. I
  really love progressive debate and I've read basically every type of argument
  that you can read (Theory, Non-T Affs, Ks, etc). I specialize in framing
  debate and really enjoy reading Identity arguments. In my free time, I like
  reading, listening to music (I listen mostly to Hiphop and RNB), and cutting
  random Ks that I'll never read. I'm super excited to work at Nova this summer
  and hope to meet all of you! "
