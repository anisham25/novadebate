bio: Hey! I’m Anya (they/them) and I’m a rising senior at Phillips Exeter. I’ve
  done five years of debate across Policy, LD, and Public Forum, and I’ve been
  mentoring students across a variety of speech and debate events for three
  years now. My specialty is in K/performance debate, though I’m also
  experienced in and happy to help students with LARP and theory. I was a
  finalist in policy for my state championship in 2018 and a NSDA nationals
  qualifier, where I also qualified to elimination rounds in NSDA Policy
  Nationals. In LD, I quartered Cypress, was top seed at Houston, and was top
  speaker/champion of Millard North, and broke at every tournament this season
  reading only performance affs/negs. I’m also a youth leader for the NYCUDL -
  feel free to ask me more about getting involved with local/nearby UDLs. I’m
  happy to work with y’all to discuss ways we can make debate a more inclusive
  and educational space, and to empower students to have the knowledge to
  express themselves in new and unexpected ways through debate. When I’m not
  debating, I love the outdoors, reading poetry, and petting dogs.
