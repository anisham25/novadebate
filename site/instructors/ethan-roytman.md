bio: Hey! I'm Ethan, and I've debated for American Heritage for three years. I
  compete in PF, reaching late out rounds at several tournaments including
  championing the Sunvitational, finaling the Strake Round Robin, quartering
  Blue Key, and many other tournaments. Outside of qualifying the TOC both my
  Sophomore and Junior years, I frequently coach and practice with teams from
  schools across the nation, helping organize pre-tournament prep and strategy.
  I also am in love with progressive argumentation (specifically theory),
  helping many others learn these skills as well. Outside of debate, I like to
  talk with friends, play video games, and enjoy Russian beverages. I'm head
  over heels with joy about  joining the Nova family this summer!
