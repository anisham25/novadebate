bio: HELLO!? I am Ethan Roytman from American Heritage Broward - my biggest
  accomplishment is having partnered with the fabulous Mason Cheng, Sharvaa
  Selvan, Mary Abi-Carry, Odin Farkas, and Evan Burkeen over the past couple of
  years. Outside of my beaming source of pride, I have qualed to TOC 3x,
  ammassed 9 bids, won UT Austin, won Sunvite, and went 2-3 at Emory. I enjoy
  all styles of debate - from progressive trickiness to slow and steady
  substance. My favorite animals are Red Pandas and Ansel Erol. I am ecstatic to
  return to nova :)
