bio: Hey! I'm Teddy (he/him) and I'm a rising senior at Durham Academy as well
  as the Co-Captain of our PF team. I've been competing on the national and
  local circuit for the past three years, and during that time I've been ranked
  as highly as the best PF team in the nation. Over the past two years, I've
  been ranked as the top team in North Carolina, qualifying to TOC and NSDA both
  years and earning 13 bids. Notably, I've championed Duke and the Strake Round
  Robin while co-championing Sunvite, UK, and the North Carolina state
  tournament twice. I also finaled the NDCA championship, semi-finaled Emory,
  and top spoke Harvard. I love helping and coaching others in debate, and have
  experience both with the Durham team and at Nova. I especially enjoy going
  over rebuttal and back-half strategy, weighing, and judge adaptation skills.
  When I'm not debating, I like to listen to Spanish rap music, sell sneakers,
  and hang out with my dogs. I canâ€™t wait to meet everyone this summer!
