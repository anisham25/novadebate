bio: Hey!! I'm Ella and I'm a rising senior at Cary Academy where I have been
  debating for three years and will be team captain next year. This year, I've
  been ranked as high as 3rd in the nation, earned 4 bids, and qualified to both
  gold TOC and NCFLs. I've also been invited to 4 round robins, and I
  semifinaled Yale, Laird Lewis, the Harvard Round Robin, and finaled Duke,
  while also reaching outrounds at GMU, Durham, and Harvard. I've also been top
  speaker at GMU, JV Yale, Virtual States, and 3 locals. I can debate prog and
  tech, but lay debate holds a special place in my heart. I am a Sheerio and
  have proudly won debate rounds because of Ed in the past, and I can type
  faster than 90% of the population. I look forward to working with you all!
