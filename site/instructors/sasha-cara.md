bio: Hi! My name is Sasha. I am a rising senior at Princeton High School and
  have been debating for three years. This year, I have accumulated 2 gold and 2
  silver bids. I championed Pennsbury, quartered at Cypress Bay and earned 6th
  Speaker at Gold TOC. I have also reached outrounds at Harvard, UK Season
  Opener, Columbia and Yale. As the Director of my schoolâ€™s Summer Debate
  Institute, I have gained experience coaching debaters of all levels. I am
  passionate about ensuring equal access to resources in debate and promoting
  gender equality in the debate space. Outside of debate, I enjoy playing
  classical guitar and ballroom dancing. I am so excited to meet everyone this
  summer!
