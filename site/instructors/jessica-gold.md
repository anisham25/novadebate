bio: "Hi! i’m Jessica and i’m a rising junior at Riverdale who’s been doing PF
  for two years. I am the youngest member of my team to break at a varsity
  tournament and have done so at three natcircuit tourneys since. I also placed
  second at the Lakeland Round Robin, octafinaled and top spoke at NDCA, and
  semifinaled the Silver TOC. I coach some of my team’s novices and
  underclassmen and I’m super excited to meet y’all at NOVA! In my free time, I
  love to play tennis, watch Netflix, cook, and I’m also in Model UN. "
