bio: Hi! I’m Zaynab Syed, and I’ve debated at Brentwood High since my freshman
  year. Currently I am the Brentwood Debate team’s novice coach where I help
  teach and run our teams practice. On the national level I’ve reached out
  rounds at tournaments such as Bellaire and Saint James, and I qualified to
  NSDA nationals last year. At the local level, I quarter finaled at the
  Tennessee State tournament and have championed and broken at multiple local
  tournaments. I'm excited to work with everyone at NOVA this year!
