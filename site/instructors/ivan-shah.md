bio: Ivan Shah (he/him) is a rising senior at DVHS in the Bay Area, California.
  He has been competing in Speech and Debate for four years and currently holds
  the position of Vice President in his school's 200-student debate team. As a
  co-Captain for the 50-student PF team, he has secured qualifications for GTOC
  and States twice, as well as Nationals. Ivan has accumulated eight PF career
  bids, positioning himself among the top 20 debaters in the nation based on
  bids. Notable accomplishments include championing at La Costa, reaching the
  semifinals at Peninsula, and the quarterfinals at Jack Howe and Berkeley. He
  has also achieved deep out-round placements at Nano Nagle, ASU, and other
  tournaments, as well as receiving top speaker awards at tournaments such as La
  Costa and UNLV. Beyond PF, Ivan has a keen interest in competing in Impromptu
  and Congressional debate. When he's not engaged in the world of debate, you'll
  often find Ivan enjoying quality time with his lovable Goldendoodle, Blaze. He
  also has a passion for skateboarding and never says no to shredding some
  slopes while skiing.
