bio: "Hey there! I’m Andrew, a rising senior and the first speaker for VDA
  Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada for over three years now. Im proud of
  what I accomplished last season with my partner Johnson: we accumulated a
  total of 6 Gold and 2 Silver bids to the Tournament of Champions. We
  championed tournaments such as the John Lewis Invitational. We octo-finaled at
  the Stanford Invitational, and quarter-finaled at the Princeton Classic. I’ve
  earned several speaker’s awards throughout my career, and broke deep into
  elimination rounds at NSDA Nationals in Louisville, Kentucky. I’m really
  passionate about debate, and I especially enjoy researching geopolitical
  arguments on regions like the Middle East and Indo-Pacific. I've also taught
  at multiple debate organizations, including non-profits, to students of a
  plethora of ages. I'm proud to have helped a lot of them break to deep
  out-rounds at many tournaments and accomplish their goals. Outside of debate,
  I enjoy reading about history and foreign policy, watching movies with
  friends, travelling the world, and occasionally dabbling in languages. I’m
  super excited to be working with everyone this summer!"
