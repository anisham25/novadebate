bio: Hi! I'm Sam Chen (he/him) and I'm a rising senior at Boston Latin School in
  MA. Throughout my sophomore and junior year, I've obtained 6 bids in PF,
  qualifying to TOC 2x, NSDA 2x, and NCFLs 2x. I've reached Quarterfinals at
  Columbia, Semifinals at Lexington, Quarters at Peach State Classic, Quarters
  at the NCFL, Octos at Milo Cup, and elimination rounds at NSDA. I've also
  obtained 1st Speaker at the Milo Cup and 2nd Speaker at Sunvite. I've taught
  at 4 other debate camps, including Nova where I was not only a camper in 2021
  and 2019 but an instructor in 2022. This will be my fourth year at Nova and I
  am so excited! Outside of Public Forum, I am dabbling in some Congressional
  debate and Worlds Schools debate. Beyond debate, I love playing some poker,
  listening to pop music, shooting some easy 3s, playing violin, and going on
  runs once in a while. Nova was truly transformative for me so I hope you  sign
  up!
