bio: Hi everyone!!! I'm Sam Chen (he/him) and I'm a sophomore at Boston Latin
  that has debated on the local and national circuit for the past three years.
  During this competitive season, I've broken at tournaments like Grapevine,
  Princeton, Apple Valley, Milo, and Lexington, amassing 4 bids (1 gold, 3
  silvers) to the Tournament of Champions. I reached semifinals at Lexington and
  was ranked as the top speaker at Milo and the second best speaker at the
  Sunvitational tournament. As one of the debate team captains, I have
  experience working with younger debaters and organizing practice. I also have
  taught at another camp and designed a part of the curriculum. In regards to
  specifics, I love narrative debate, weighing, analyzing speeches, and
  maximizing rebuttal efficiency; I have experience in lay debate,  progressive
  argumentation, and even congress (ewwww). Outside of debate, I enjoy playing
  violin, running, and listening to wayyy too basic music. Also, I'm very down
  to play minecraft with fellow debaters. I can't wait to instruct y'all !! :))
