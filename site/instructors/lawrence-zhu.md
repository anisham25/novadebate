bio: Hello! I'm Lawrence, and I debated for Oakton and now for the University of
  Pennsylvania. In high school I competed in PF, receiving seven bids and
  ranking high as first nationally while competing locally, and in college I've
  broken at various APDA tournaments. I was the President of the Oakton team my
  senior year, and since graduating I've coached many teams who regularly break
  on the national circuit. I'm excited to instruct this summer!
