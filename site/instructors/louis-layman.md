bio: Hey! I’m Louis (he/him) and I’m a rising senior at The Peddie School in NJ.
  I’ve debated for two years on the national circuit as the first team from our
  school to compete. This year, I earned 6 bids along with a few speaker awards,
  qualifying to the TOC and Nationals. Notably, I co-championed the Cal RR and
  SF Roosevelt with different partners, as well as making late out-rounds at
  Princeton and Berkeley. Outside of PF, I love listening to music, watching
  movies, and chilling with friends. I’m super hyped to teach y’all at Nova this
  summer!
