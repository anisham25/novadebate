bio: Hey I’m Fiona (she/they), and I’m a rising senior. I debated for three
  years at the Overlake school in Washington, winning my district tournament,
  qualifying to nationals and becoming the first to team to fully qualify for
  toc gold at my school. I also did wsd and reached eliminations at nats and won
  state. In my free time I like to watch kdramas on Netflix and make random
  playlists on Spotify.  I can't wait to be instructing at NOVA this summer!
