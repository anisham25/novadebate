bio: Hi all! I'm Jennifer (she/her) and am a rising senior at BASIS Chandler.
  I've been debating in public forum since 10th grade and have debated in both
  the national and local circuit. As the debate co-captain at my school, I have
  started the public forum program, coached novices, revised cases, and have
  helped debators improve their backhalf strategies. Over the course of my
  debate journey, I have acquired two gold bids and four silver bids, championed
  states, broke at Nationals placing top 37, and have received top five speaker
  awards throughout the year. Outside of debate, I'm an avid reader who loves
  cooking, gardening, and spending time with my friends and family. I'm super
  excited to be working with NOVA this summer and can't wait to meet you all!
