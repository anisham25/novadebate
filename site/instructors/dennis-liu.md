bio: Hello! I’m Dennis and I’m currently a rising senior at Peddie where I’ve
  been debating on the national circuit since my sophomore year. This past year
  I’ve accumulated 5 bids to the tournament of champions, qualified to NSDA
  nationals and co-champed the Berkeley Round Robin. Additionally, I’ve reached
  outrounds at various national tournaments including Princeton, UK season
  opener, Berkeley, Stanford, Georgetown, and SCU where I also earned 4th place
  speaker. Outside of competing I helped start and co-lead my school's debate
  team helping novices to breaks and also currently teach middle schoolers in my
  town. During my free time I love playing basketball, drums, piano, and
  watching good movies. Most importantly however, I’m a diehard Kobe Bryant fan.
  I look forward to meeting everyone!
