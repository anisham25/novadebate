bio: What's up! I'm Jae (he/him) and I'm a rising college freshman and debated
  for three years at Torrey Pines High School where I served as Vice President
  of Speech and Debate as well as being a PF captain. I qualled to NDCA and TOC
  twice, quartered Arizona State and UNLV, top seeded Cal State Fullerton, and
  reached elimination rounds at Jack Howe, Nano Nagle, La Costa, Lexington,
  Berkeley, and Peninsula over the course of my career. I have plenty of
  experience in both technical and lay debate, along with independently
  coaching. Outside of debate, I play lacrosse, badminton (which I suck at), and
  enjoy a lot of gaming. I attended NOVA as a freshman and I'm excited to work
  with y'all this summer!
