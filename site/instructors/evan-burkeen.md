bio: Hey! I’m Evan (he/him), and I was one of the Co-Directors for NOVA 2022,
  and this year I will be overseeing administration. I am a rising Senior at
  American Heritage in Florida and serve as a Captain on our Public Forum Team.
  In my career, I’ve qualified to FFL, NSDA, and TOC, and reached deep outrounds
  at tournaments such as Yale, GMU, and Emory. I enjoy all types of debate,
  ranging from lay to progressive. In my off time, I am a PASSIONATE listener of
  music and I love debating (no surprise there) about which artists are the best
  (Playboi Carti). This is my third year at NOVA, and I’m excited to see y’all
  this summer!
