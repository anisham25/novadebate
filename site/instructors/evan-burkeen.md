bio: Hey! I’m Evan (he/him), and I was one of the Co-Directors for NOVA 2022,
  and this year I will be overseeing administration. I am a rising first-year at
  Yale University, and during high-school, served as President on the Speech &
  Debate Team. In my career, I’ve qualified to FFL, NSDA, and TOC, and reached
  deep outrounds at tournaments such as Yale, Sunvite, and Emory. I enjoy all
  types of debate, ranging from lay to progressive. This is my fourth year at
  NOVA, and I’m excited to see y’all this summer!
