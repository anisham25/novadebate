bio: Hey! I’m Evan (he/him), and I was one of the Co-Directors for NOVA 2022,
  and this year I will be overseeing administration. I am a Senior at American
  Heritage in Florida and serve as President on our Speech & Debate. In my
  career, I’ve qualified to FFL, NSDA, and TOC, and reached deep outrounds at
  tournaments such as Yale, Sunvite, and Emory. I enjoy all types of debate,
  ranging from lay to progressive. This is my fourth year at NOVA, and I’m
  excited to see y’all this summer!
