bio: Hey! I'm Evan, and I've debated for American Heritage for two years. I
  compete in PF, reaching late outrounds at several tournaments including
  Semifinaling the GMU Patriot Games and Quarterfinaling the Florida State
  tournament. Outside of qualifying to both the TOC and to NSDA Nationals, I
  frequently coach and practice with novices from many various schools, helping
  organize pre-tournament prep. I also am very familiar with progressive
  argumentation, helping many others learn these skills as well. Outside of
  debate, I like to talk with friends and I enjoy watching anime. I'm ecstatic
  to join NOVA this summer!
