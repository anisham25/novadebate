bio: Hi! I'm Mac and I'm a rising sophomore at Brown University with 4 years of
  national and local circuit PF experience at Durham Academy. I now compete in
  APDA Debate at the college level. In my senior year I placed 4th at NSDA
  nationals, acquired 4 gold bids to the TOC, championed 4 tournaments including
  GMU and Holy Cross and reached late out rounds at numerous major tournaments
  such as ASU, Blue Key, Emory, Yale, and NCFLs, receiving an auto-qual to the
  TOC junior year. Starting with novices in my senior year, I have been coaching
  students in PF to widespread success, working with camps such as Delta Debate
  Academy, Platinum, Beyond Resolved, ISD, Atlas, and NOVA. Throughout the past
  season, I have worked privately with many different teams, coaching them to a
  total of 31 bids to the TOC as well as numerous top speaking positions and
  championships of both national circuit and district and state tournaments. I'm
  excited to work at NOVA this year!
