bio: Hi, I’m Anisha (she/her) and I’m a rising junior at Edgemont High School in
  New York. I’ve been the captain of Public Forum Debate since 9th grade and
  been debating since 7th grade. This season, I’ve amassed 5 bids and received
  several speaker awards. Notably, I finaled Lexington, semied Blake, and
  reached late outrounds at Sunvite, Emory, and Grapevine. In my free time, I
  like to play field hockey, skateboard, and mess around with computers. I’m
  really excited to meet everyone at Nova!
