bio: Hello! I'm Sim (she/they) and I'm studying Biology and Africana Studies at
  Johns Hopkins. I competed in policy and public forum for Westview, and I
  qualified to the TOC in PF during my senior year after reaching finals of
  Puget Sound and Lewis & Clark. Since graduating, I've been coaching policy
  debate where my students' notable accomplishments include a full ride
  scholarship from a college debate program and making the coaches' list. My
  specialty would be progressive and kritikal arguments, but I'm happy to help
  with fundamentals, research, or anything else! Other than debate, I like
  crocheting and matcha lattes. Super excited to see y'all this summer!
