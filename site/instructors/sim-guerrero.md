bio: "Hello! My name is Sim (they/them) and I have been involved in debate for
  seven years now. I competed in Policy and Public Forum when I was in high
  school, and since graduating in 2019, I have been judging and coaching across
  all formats while competing in the college parliamentary format. My students
  have as made it as far as Finals of NDCAs and Quarters of the TOC, earning
  countless speaker awards and breaks at majors along the way. I specialize in
  kritikal argumentation, but I was a flex debater myself and have an
  appreciation for a wide variety of strategies (minus tricks). Please reach out
  if you would be interested in learning more \"progressive\" argumentation, I'm
  happy to help students at any skill level! "
