bio: Hey there! I debated for three years at Walt Whitman High School in
  Bethesda, Maryland. Over my career, I qualified to the Tournament of Champions
  three times, earning 13 gold bids and ranking within the top ten nationally
  during my junior and senior year. I won the Mid America Cup twice, was a
  finalist the Harvard Round Robin, was a semi-finalist at the Ivy Street Round
  Robin, Blake, and the Blake Round Robin, and earned speaker awards at all of
  the above including four top speaker awards. Additionally, I reached late
  elimination rounds at countless national tournaments including Harvard,
  Stanford, Villiger, Bellaire, and Laird Lewis. I have extensive experience
  instructing young debaters, having taught at NOVA and other debate camps,
  mentored and coached teams with a variety of skill levels, and served as the
  captain of Whitman’s debate team. More importantly, I love Charli XCX and
  playing Minecraft with my little brother. I can’t wait to meet all of you this
  summer!
