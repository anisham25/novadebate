bio: Yo! I’m Sophia and I’m very excited to return to NOVA this summer! I’m a
  rising senior at Walt Whitman High School and I have been competing on the
  national circuit for the past two years. During that time, I qualified to the
  Tournament of Champions twice, earning 8 gold bids. This year, I won the Mid
  America Cup, finaled the Harvard Round Robin, and quartered Blake, Stanford,
  and Harvard. I taught at two debate camps last summer, mentored a few kids
  during the regular season, (two of whom bid— shoutout Gabby and Robby,) and
  have been heavily involved with instructing Whitman’s novices. I can’t wait to
  see y’all this summer!
