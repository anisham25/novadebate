bio: Hi! I'm Andrew Thong, and I debated for Oakton High School and currently
  attend the University of Virginia. In my junior year, I qualified to the
  Tournament of Champions, but due to financial issues, I was unable to attend.
  Afterwards, I decided to dedicate my participation in debate to breaking down
  financial barriers, such as volunteering at my local urban debate league,
  providing free coaching, and ultimately deciding to make NOVA Debate Camp free
  of charge. I currently coach teams from Ardrey Kell and Oakton, both of which
  have fully qualified to the Gold TOC. I can't wait for NOVA this year!
