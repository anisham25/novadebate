bio: "Hi! I'm Aaron and I'm a rising sophomore at Thomas Wootton High School in
  Maryland. I'm a captain of my school's debate team and have been debating for
  around 4 years on the national and local circuits. I've been ranked as high as
  top 3 teams in the country, and amassed 5 gold bids to the Tournament of
  Champions. Notably, I championed SVUDL and reached semifinals at UPenn and
  Harvard. I enjoy both technical and lay styles of debate, and have experience
  in all types of argument. Outside of debate I enjoy listening to music and
  hanging out with friends. I'm super excited to get to work with everyone!  "
