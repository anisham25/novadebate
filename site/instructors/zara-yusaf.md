bio: Hi! I’m Zara and I debate for Hackley in Tarrytown, NY! I’m a sophomore and
  have debated PF for two years on the national circuit. In my freshman year, I
  broke at multiple national circuit tournaments, and in my sophomore year I
  co-champed the New York City Invitational (Big Bronx)! I’ve worked at a few
  Parli debate camps over the years, and this year I’ve taken the lead in
  teaching my school’s novice PF team. Outside of debate, I love finding new
  music and laughing at super mediocre Instagram memes. I’m super excited to be
  working at Nova this summer :))
