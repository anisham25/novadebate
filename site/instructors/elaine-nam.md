bio: "Hi, I'm Elaine (she/her), and I am a rising senior at Bergen County
  Academies, which is located in New Jersey! I have been competing in Public
  Forum since seventh grade, and this will be my second summer working at NOVA.
  I have been a mentor for Speech and Debate to my own school's team, which I am
  the captain of. Currently, I have accumulated 3 career Tournament of Champion
  bids and am the Chapter Head for Beyond Resolved NJ. I really value equity and
  diversity in debate and have loved running some unique arguments tackling
  real-world issues, especially related to women's rights and gender equality.
  Some fun facts about me: I love Olivia Rodrigo, I have a 9-year-old toy poodle
  named Sarie, and I am super interested in politics! I am really excited to be
  working at NOVA this year and can't wait to see all of you improve with our
  help."
