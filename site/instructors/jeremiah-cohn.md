bio: Hi I'm Jeremiah (he/him). Over my 4 years debating I've earned over 7 bids
  with 4 partners in Public Forum. As well as reaching 3 bid rounds in LD my
  Senior year. Iâ€™ve debated both super lay and hyper technical styles in both LD
  and PF. I have a deep understanding of Theory, Kritiks, and Tricks. And I have
  already coached multiple teams specifically with these arguments, all of which
  found success. Outside of debate I spend my time playing Poker, Magic The
  Gathering, League and Apex (as well as fostering a hardstyle music addiction.)
