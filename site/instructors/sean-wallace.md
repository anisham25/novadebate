bio: I'm Sean! I've been debating for 6 years at Sidwell Friends School in DC,
  with experience in MSPDP, Public Forum, and Lincoln Douglas. In my two years
  on the national circuit, I have achieved 11 total bids to the TOC (8 in PF, 3
  in LD), as well as championing Stanford (LD), Pennsbury, and SCU. I have
  experience going for and answering all different sorts of arguments, and am
  most comfortable helping with traditional policy style debate, kritikal
  debate, framing, and theory. I'm also comfortable with lay debate and judge
  adaptation, winning my circuit's regional championship and qualifying to NCFL
  Grand Nationals. Finally, I have two years of experience working with mentees
  in both LD and PF and coaching the Sidwell PF team. In my free time I like
  running and listening to Frank Ocean and JID :) I'm excited to work with you
  all!
