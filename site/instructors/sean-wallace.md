bio: Hi! I'm Sean (they/she) and I'm a junior at Sidwell Friends where I compete
  in LD and PF. This season, I've amassed 7 bids across events, with 6 and a
  100% bid rate in PF. Notably, I championed SCU, reached semis at Jack Howe and
  Pennsbury, and finalled Houston in LD. I also coach a few teams independently
  through The Debate Group, bringing one of my teams from consistently not
  breaking to bidding and consistently reaching the bid round. I'm excited to
  work with y'all at NOVA!
