bio: Hi my name is George! I've debated in PF for 2 years for Lambert High
  School. In my sophomore year, I semifinaled the Silver TOC in and gained two
  silver bids during the season. This season I have accumulated three golds and
  one silver bid, finaled Grapevine, won Bellaire without dropping a ballot, and
  reached deep outrounds at almost every tournament I have gone to. I have also
  been ranked as high as third in the nation. In my free time I enjoy playing
  Valorant way too much for my own good.
