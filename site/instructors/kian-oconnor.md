bio: Hi! I’m Kian (he/him) and I’ve debated at Chaska for four years. This year,
  I’ve received eight bids to the TOC, including five gold bids. Most notably,
  I’ve reached semifinals at Glenbrooks and quaterfinals at Blake and Emory.
  Additionally, as captain of Chaska’s debate team, I’ve helped our novices
  attain success on the Minnesota local circuit. When I’m not debating, I enjoy
  bowling, playing ultimate frisbee, and hanging with friends. I can’t wait to
  meet y’all at NOVA this summer!
