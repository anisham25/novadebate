bio: Hi, I'm Michaela Frey (she/her) and I'm a rising sophomore at Langley High
  School. I did MSPDP at Longfellow MS and currently do public forum. I work
  with novices at my school and compete on the local Virginia circuit as well as
  the national circuit. This year, I qualified to metrofinals, TOC, and placed
  4th at States. Outside of school, I like to paint and read, and I spend a lot
  of time listening to music, specifically The Crane Wives. This is my first
  year teaching at NOVA and I'm looking forward to it!
