bio: "Hi! I am Mathan Liu. I am a rising senior at East Ridge High School in
  Minnesota. I have served as the Captain for the East Ridge High School debate
  team, and have led the team to compete on the national circuit. I have been
  debating for three years in both Public Forum and World Schools Debate. I have
  qualified to NSDA nationals all three years I have been debating, and have
  broken to late out rounds in World Schools Debate. This year, I have broken to
  out rounds at TOC Digital #1, Columbia, and Stanford. I have lots of
  experience in both lay and tech debate. I love teaching lay appeal as well as
  creative weighing strategies! Outside of debate, I love playing soccer,
  playing video games, and going skateboarding. I am beyond ecstatic to be
  teaching at NOVA this year!"
