bio: "Hi!! I am Sam (she/her) and I am a rising junior at Bronx Science in NYC.
  I have been debating since 6th grade (parliamentary) and doing PF since 9th
  grade on both the national and local circuit. This past year, my partner and I
  made it to quarters at silver TOC as well as breaking at UPenn and Yale. Next
  year, I will serve as one of the novice directors for PF at my school. I enjoy
  all types of debate and have learned some progressive debate this past year.
  Outside of debate, I am an avid Ariana Grande and Gracie Abrams fan. Last
  summer I attended NOVA and I am so excited to work with everyone this summer!
