bio: Hey! My name is Naman Mukerji, and I'm a rising senior at Ravenwood High
  School located in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am a mentor at my own school where I
  help to lead the varsity debate team as well as offer guidance to middle
  schoolers who plan on pursuing debate as they become high schoolers. I am a
  national tournament qualifier, gold TOC qualifier with four bids this year,
  and a former top 15 debater in the nation, and I really value debate because
  it helps teach students public speaking skills, helps students learn about
  current issues in our world, and helps to form friendships and meaningful
  relationships. Outside of debate, I enjoy playing guitar, tennis, and
  photography.
