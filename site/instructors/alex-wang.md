bio: Hi! I’m Alex Wang and I am currently a junior at Oakton High School. I’ve
  debated for three years and am now the Varsity Public Forum Coach at Oakton
  where I coach dozens of teammates. In my junior year, I broke at the
  University of Kentucky Season Opener and earned a speaker award at the John
  Lewis SVUDL Invitational. Aside from debate, I love eating and I can’t stand
  mint chocolate chip ice cream. See you all at NOVA this year!
