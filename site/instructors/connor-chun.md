bio: Hey there! My name is Connor and I'm a rising sophomore at Langley High
  School. I did MSPDP in middle school and started PF in my freshmen year. This
  year, my partner and I qualified to Metrofinals four times, the VA state
  championship, and TOC at Laird Lewis invitational. I've coached many of the
  novices at Langley, and specifically focus on crafting lay narratives. Outside
  of debate, I love playing violin and rock climbing. I was a student last year
  at NOVA, and I'm super excited to return as an instructor!
