bio: Hi! I'm Daniel (he/him), and I'm a rising senior at Leland in California.
  During my four-year career, I've qualified to NSDAs and TOC, obtaining 5 total
  TOC bids, most notably championing the SCU Invitational and placing second and
  top speaker at the Stephen Stewart Invitational. I also placed 12th at this
  year's National Speech and Debate Tournament, auto-qualifying to next year's
  NSDA Nationals and TOC. Currently, I'm a co-captain of Leland's Public Forum
  team, where I teach and coach a team of 20+ debaters. I've had a blast working
  with the Leland team and am excited to carry my experience over to NOVA. In my
  free time I enjoy skiing and playing video games. Looking forward to working
  with you all!
