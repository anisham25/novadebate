bio: Hi! I’m Veer (he/him) and I’m a rising senior at Durham Academy. I’ve been
  debating for three years locally and nationally. I’ve reached as high as 14th
  in the country at the national tournament and also have qualified for TOC. At
  our local level, I’ve also earned success by co-championing our state
  tournament. Beyond individual achievements, I’ve been working hard with the
  novices and JVers at Durham to teach them what I’ve learned throughout my
  career. I’ve spoken first and second intermittently, but I love thinking about
  back half strategy and weighing, especially as someone who has seen both lay
  and flow rounds. Outside of the debate world, I love to listen to music (lots
  of Carti and Kanye), spend time with my friends and family, and bother Teddy.
  I’m so excited to be a part of Nova this summer!
