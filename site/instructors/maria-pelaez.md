bio: Hi! I’m Maria (she/her) and I go to BASIS Shavano in San Antonio, Texas,
  where I am a rising Junior. I started debate in 8th grade, and started
  competing heavily my freshman year. I was vice president of my debate team my
  sophomore year, and I also taught our PF novices. I’ve qualified for NSDA
  nationals twice in PF, semifinaled at UIL CX state, qualified for TFA state in
  PF, and dabbled in Congress and Extemp (state qualifying for both). Outside of
  debate, I love going to the gym, hanging out with my little brother, and
  making playlists. I went to NOVA for two years, and it was super helpful, so
  I’m really looking forward to being an instructor!
