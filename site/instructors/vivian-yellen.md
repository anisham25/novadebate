bio: "Hi! Im Viv (she/her) and I co directed NOVA in 2022 and will be overseeing
  camp this year. I debated myself for four years at The Bronx High School of
  Science in New York City. As a competitor, I placed 10th at Nationals in 2021,
  and reached octofinals at both the 2022 Grand Nationals and the 2022  Gold
  TOC, receiving three separate TOC auto-qualifications. In addition, I have
  received gold bids at tournaments such as Glenbrooks, Harvard, and Durham. I
  love to come up with creative case strategies, and help students with
  developing skills in weighing and round vision. I also have experience in
  theory and other more progressive forms of argumentation. "
