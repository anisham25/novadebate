bio: "Hi! Im Viv (she/her) and ill be one of the Co-Directors for NOVA 2022. I
  am a rising Senior at Bronx Science in NYC and serve as one of my teams
  Captains and Novice Directors. In debate, I have amassed a total of 5 bids
  including golds at Durham, Glenbrooks and Harvard. Last year, I placed 10th at
  the National Speech and Debate Tournament earning a Auto-Qualifcation to the
  TOC. Most recently, I got to Octo-Finals at the 2022 Gold TOC, earning an
  Auto-Qual for next year. I love all styles of debate, in particular
  traditional yet technical rounds; but I do have experience in theory and lay
  debate. In my free time I love listening to music, watching TV and going on
  bike rides. I cant wait to work with everyone!
