bio: Hi i’m Viv (she/her) and i’m going to be a junior at Bronx Science! I’ve
  been dabbling in public forum since back in middle school. During this season,
  I broke at 5+ tournaments earning a gold bid at Harvard. I also qualified to
  both Nationals and NCFLs. I have experience helping middle schoolers and
  novices and i’m super excited to work with you all this summer!
