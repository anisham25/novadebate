bio: Hi guys! My name is Faith (she/her) and I'm a rising junior at Dulaney High
  School in Baltimore Maryland. This will be my third year of debating in a
  public forum. During this time, my partner and I have qualified for TOC, NSDA
  Nationals and amassed bronze at states to NCFL Grand Nationals. As a leader
  and topic analyst of my high school's debate team, I have gotten to watch my
  peers grow as debaters and people. In my free time, I love to figure skate. I
  am so excited to teach at NOVA this summer :)))
