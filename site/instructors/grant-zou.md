bio: Hi! I'm Grant Zou and I'm a junior at Oakton High School. I have debated
  since my freshman year and have competed at local and national circuit
  tournaments. Currently I'm co-novice coach for the Oakton team. Besides debate
  I like to cook and eat all sorts of food. I look forward to seeing you at
  NOVA!
