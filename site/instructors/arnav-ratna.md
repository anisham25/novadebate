bio: Hey! I'm Arnav (he/him), and I'm a current PF debater at College Prep. I'm
  going into my fourth year of debate in high school, and I've qualified to TOC
  my sophomore and junior years with a total of 6 career bids. I've been ranked
  as high as 11th in the nation, reaching semis at silver TOC, quarters at
  Stanford, octas at Bellaire, Glenbrooks, Palm Classic, and Sunvite, and top 2
  prelim seeds at Glenbrooks and Columbia. I've also earned a few speaker
  awards, including second at Glenbrooks. Some of my favorite parts of debate
  are frontlining, weighing, and writing squirrelly arguments. Outside of
  debate, I love solving Rubik's cubes, shuffling cards, doing math
  competitions, and playing the violin. I'm really excited to be at NOVA and
  can't wait to work with y'all!
